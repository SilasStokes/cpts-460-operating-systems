which will be explaned in class. Listen to lecture

=============================================================================
The timer driver in timer.c generates 60 interrupts per second.
It displays a   timer interrupt  line on the LCD every second.

1. Per the timer driver in the book, display a wall-clock for timer 0

2. Make the cursor flashing once every second.

	        3. HOW TO do device I/O by interrupts:

Submit a (text-edited) file of your answer to TA BEFORE demo time
3.1. Device must be allowed to generate interrupts:
    Q: Where and how (C code) did we enable timers to generate interrupts?
    A:  The interrupts are enabled using *(VIC_BASE + VIC_INTENABLE) |= (1<<4);

3.2. Device interrupts must be routed to IRQ input pin of CPU:

    Q: Where and how (C code) and how did we route timer interrupts to CPU?
    A:      in timer_init when we defined the offset from tp -> base 

3.3. Device must be enabled to operate:

    Q: Where and how did we enable timer 0 ?
    A:      timer_init
    Q: What would happen if we do NOT enable timer 0?
    A:      There would be no interrupts

3.4 CPU must have IRQ unmasked (CPSR.I_bit=1 mask out IRQ)

    Q: Where and how did we let CPU run with IRQ unmasked?
    A:      during the svc mode
    Q: What happens if we  MSR cpsr, #0x93   then call main()? (TRY it!)
    A:      The interrupts are turned off. 

3.5. Must have an interrupt handler installed to handle timer interrupts:

    (1). What does copy_vectors() do? WHY?
        it sets up the exception vector table.

    (2). CPU is excuting in a while(1); loop.
        Show the control flow of CPU when a timer interrupt occurs:

        while(1) => vectorTable.0x18 => irq_handler => irq_chandler => back to interrupted point

Sorry jimmy - ran out of time while working on this. Had some other assignments due.
